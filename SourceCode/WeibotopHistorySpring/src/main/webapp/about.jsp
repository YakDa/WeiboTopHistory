			This Website is used to record all the topics from Weibo top 50 since 30 May 2020. From here you can see the traffic on each topic, when it
			entered Weibo top 50, the last time it entered Weibo top 50 and so on. Some of its content which is saved in the server, so you don't need
			to worry that the content is already expired in the Weibo.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Here I need to explain the duration of one topic. The duration is the accumulated time which shows how long the topic in top 50 in total. So
			it does's have to equal to the last entered time minus the first entered time, because some topic could enter, leave and enter again. So that is
			the differences

			My name is Mingda. This Website is developed for me to learn Website development. The GUI is a bit ugly :(, because I am still learning, and this
			 Website is still in development. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me below. I will be very thankful. <br>
